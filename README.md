# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

The study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notess on HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript

- What was your motivation?

My motivation is to develop my skills as a software developer and create a solid foundation for a career in software development.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I built this project to gain an introductory insight into what it takes to be a software developer, while working through a guided project to apply the skills into a real world application setting. While this project is a level 0 project, it is a still a solid way of introducing new programmers to the elements of HTML, styling of CSS, functionality of JS, and version control of Git.

- What problem does it solve?

This solved the problem of introducing students to various introductory elements of becoming a software developer. This did so by creating a step by step guide while providing some additional conceptual explanations.

- What did you learn?

Most of the material here was review for me, but I did learn a bit about using Git for version control. Though I do have some questions and look forward to speaking with a professor to get a bit more assistance with Git.
